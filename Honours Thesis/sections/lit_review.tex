\section{Results for non-large base primitive permutation groups}

Suppose we have a finite primitive permutation group $G$ of degree $n$. What can we say about $|G|$? (This problem attracted a lot of attention in the 19th century, as noted in \cite{moscatiello_roney-dougal2021}.) Of course, $|G| \leq n!$, and in the case that $G = \Sym(n)$ which is primitive, we have equality. In the case that $G = \Alt(n)$ which is also primitive, we have $|G| = n!/2 = O(n!)$, which suggests that even in nontrivial cases, the bound cannot be significantly improved on without further restrictions.

From \autoref{lem:blaha_nonredundant_size}, we have that $|G| \leq n^{b(G)}$. Thus, we may find upper bounds on $|G|$ by finding upper bounds on $b(G)$. One of the first results in this direction came in 1889, when Bochert proved in \cite{bochert1889} that for a primitive group $G$ of degree $n$ not containing the alternating group $\Alt(n)$, then $b(G) \leq n/2$. Compare this to \autoref{eg:symmetric_group_base} and \autoref{eg:alternating_group_base}, where we showed that $b(\Sym(n)) = n-1$ and $b(\Alt(n)) = n-2$, so the condition of not containing the alternating group immediately leads the upper bound on $b(G)$ improving by a factor of 2. Of course, since $\Alt(n)$ has index 2 in $\Sym(n)$, it is maximal, and thus every primitive group $G$ of degree $n$, apart from $\Alt(n)$ and $\Sym(n)$, has $b(G) \leq n/2$.

Improvements to these bounds have been made for primitive groups with certain additional properties. In 1984, Liebeck used the \hyperref[thm:cfsg]{classification of finite simple groups} and the \hyperref[thm:onan-scott]{O'Nan-Scott theorem} to improve the bound on $b(G)$ for \textit{non-large base} permutation groups.

\begin{definition}\label{def:large_base}
    A permutation group $G$ of degree $n$ is \textbf{large base} if there are integers $m$ and $r \geq 1$ with
    $$\Alt(m)^r \unlhd G \leq \Sym(m) \wr \Sym(r),$$
    where $\Sym(m)$ \hyperref[eg:product_action_Sm_subsets]{acts on $k$-element subsets} of $\{1,\dotsc,m\}$ for some $k$, and the \hyperref[def:wreath_product]{wreath product} has the \hyperref[def:product_action]{product action} of degree $n = \binom{m}{k}^r$ if $r > 1$.

    (Note that here we mean that $G$ contains a subgroup that is isomorphic to $\Alt(m)^r$, and $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of the wreath product $\Sym(m) \wr \Sym(r)$. Such convention is common in the literature, where inclusion is up to isomorphism.)
\end{definition}

By this definition, $\Alt(n)$ and $\Sym(n)$ with their natural actions are large base, where we choose $m = n$ and $r = 1$; recall that $\Sym(n) \wr \Sym(1) \cong \Sym(n)$, and $\Alt(n) \unlhd \Sym(n)$. Thus, the non-large base primitive groups exclude $\Alt(n)$ and $\Sym(n)$, and there is no conflict with Bochert's result in \cite{bochert1889}. The following result by Liebeck is found in \cite{liebeck1984}.

\begin{theorem}[Liebeck, 1984]\label{thm:liebeck1984}
    Let $G$ be a primitive group of degree $n$. Then one of the following holds:
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item $G$ is \hyperref[def:large_base]{large base}; or
        \item $b(G) < 9\log n$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

The result was proven in context improving lower bounds on $\mu(G)$, the \textbf{minimal degree} of $G \leq \Sym(\Omega)$, which is the smallest number of points moved by any non-identity element in $G$, i.e.
$$\mu(G) = \min_{g \in G \setminus \{1\}}|\{\alpha \in \Omega : \alpha^g \neq \alpha\}|.$$
For example, $\mu(\Alt(n)) = 3$ for $n \geq 3$, since $\Alt(n)$ contains 3-cycles (which move 3 points) but no transpositions (which move 2 points). From the relation that $b(G)\mu(G) \geq n$ for any transitive group $G$ of degree $n$, Liebeck concludes that either $G$ is large base, or that $\mu(G) > n/(9 \log n)$. The best result that was previously available, due to Babai in \cite{babai1981}, was that $\mu(G) > (1/2)(\sqrt{n} - 1)$ as long as $\Alt(n) \not\leq G$ (which would give, by properties of \hyperref[def:big_O_notation]{big-O},
$$b(G) < 2\sqrt{n}\left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)^{-1} = 2\sqrt{n}\left(1 + O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)\right) = 2\sqrt{n} + O(1) = O(\sqrt{n}),$$
i.e. a square-root bound on $b(G)$); the logarithmic bound on $b(G)$ in Liebeck represented a major improvement, and has been seen as a remarkable result \cite{moscatiello_roney-dougal2021}.

Liebeck's proof of \autoref{thm:liebeck1984} in \cite{liebeck1984} is approached in four steps. Firstly, a reduction to simple socle is performed: supposing the theorem is true for primitive groups with a nonabelian simple socle, then considering arbitrary primitive $G$ to prove part (i) of the theorem. Then, by considering cases in the O'Nan-Scott theorem, Liebeck shows that it suffices to assume $\Soc(G) = T$ is simple. The second step uses the \hyperref[thm:cfsg]{classification of finite simple groups} to analyse the structure of the nonabelian simple socle $T$, leading to the conclusion that $T$ is an alternating group, a group of Lie type, or a sporadic group, or that $|G| < n^9$. The third step shows that these non-large base groups from step two satisfy (ii) in \autoref{thm:liebeck1984}, and step four uses the previous steps to complete the proof.

In 2019, Halasi, Liebeck and Mar\'oti show in Theorem 1.1 of \cite{halasi2019} that the minimal base size of an arbitrary primitive group of degree $n$ satisfies $b(G) \leq 2(\log|G|/\log n) + 24$, with the multiplcative constant 2 being best possible, answering the well-known \textit{Pyber's conjecture} of the existence of a universal constant $c$ with $b(G) < c(\log|G|/\log n)$ for all primitive groups $G$, which was open until initially proven in 2018. In particular, \cite{halasi2019} shows that for most non-large base primitive groups $G$, the minimum base size satisfies $b(G) \leq 2\lfloor\log n\rfloor + 26$; in 2020, ``most'' was improved to \textit{``all''} \cite{moscatiello_roney-dougal2021}.

In 2021, building on the previously mentioned results of Liebeck in \cite{liebeck1984} and Halasi, Liebeck and Mar\'oti in \cite{halasi2019}, Moscatiello and Roney-Dougal improve the bound on $b(G)$ to $\lceil\log n\rceil + 1$ for non-large base primitive groups, with one exception. The following is Theorem 1 in this paper \cite{moscatiello_roney-dougal2021}; it is the main result.

\begin{theorem}[Moscatiello and Roney-Dougal, 2021]\label{thm:moscatiello_roney-dougal2021_1}
    Let $G$ be primitive group of degree $n$. If $G$ is non-\hyperref[def:large_base]{large base}, then either:
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item $G$ is the Mathieu group $M_{24}$ in its 5-transitive action of degree 24; or
        \item $b(G) \leq \lceil\log n\rceil + 1$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Moreover, there are infinitely many $G$ that are non-large base, for which $b(G) > \log n + 1$.
\end{theorem}

The \textbf{Mathieu groups} are five sporadic simple permutation groups $M_{11}$, $M_{12}$, $M_{22}$, $M_{23}$ and $M_{24}$ of degree 11, 12, 22, 23 and 24 respectively, with multiply transitive actions. They were introduced by Mathieu between 1861 and 1873, and were the first sporadic simple groups to be discovered. The final observation in \autoref{thm:moscatiello_roney-dougal2021_1} considers groups $G$ with $\log n + 1 < b(G) \leq \lceil\log n\rceil + 1$ (aside from the one exception of $M_{24}$), which would require that $b(G) = \lceil\log n\rceil + 1$ and that $n$ is not a power of 2.

Next, we present Theorem 5 from \cite{moscatiello_roney-dougal2021}, which is a more detailed version of \autoref{thm:moscatiello_roney-dougal2021_1}. It mostly investigates the case in (ii) above of $\log n + 1 \leq b(G) \leq \lceil\log n\rceil + 1$, which collapses to $b(G) = \lceil\log n\rceil + 1$.

\begin{theorem}[Moscatiello and Roney-Dougal, 2021]\label{thm:moscatiello_roney-dougal2021_5}
    Let $G$ be primitive subgroup of $\Sym(\Omega)$ with $|\Omega| = n$. Then $b(G) \geq \log n + 1$ if and only if $G$ is one of following:
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item A subgroup of $\AGL_d(2)$ with $b(G) = d + 1 = \log n + 1$.
        \item The \hyperref[def:symplectic_group]{symplectic group} $\Sp_d(2)$ (acting on cosets of $\GO^-_d(2)$) with $d \geq 4$; then $\log n + 1 < b(G) = \lceil\log n\rceil + 1$.
        \item A Mathieu group $M_n$ in its natural permutation representation with $n \in \{12,23,24\}$. If $n = 12$ or $23$ then $b(G) = \lceil\log n\rceil + 1$, while if $n = 24$ then $b(G) = 7 > \lceil\log n\rceil + 1$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

The infinite number of primitive groups $G$ of degree $n$ with $b(G) > \log n + 1$, as mentioned in \autoref{thm:moscatiello_roney-dougal2021_1}, is demonstrated by case (ii) in the more detailed theorem above; in case (i), it is conditional on the existence of such subgroups $G \leq \AGL_d(2)$ with $b(G) = d + 1$. Thus, the authors conclude the paper \cite{moscatiello_roney-dougal2021} with a question:

\begin{question}[Moscatiello and Roney-Dougal, 2021]
    Which primitive groups $G \leq \Sym(n)$ satisfy $b(G) = \log n + 1$?
\end{question}

Of course, we require that $\log n$ is an integer, so that $n$ is a power of 2. They observe that we must have $G \leq \AGL_d(2)$ for some $d$ (indeed, $\AGL_d(2)$ acts on $2^d$ points), and if $d$ is even then groups such as the split extension $2^d : \Sp_d(2)$ have this property. Investigating this question forms the remainder of this \thesis{}.

\section{Primitive subgroups of affine groups with given minimal base size}

The authors of \cite{moscatiello_roney-dougal2021} then present a question, which asks to identify primitive groups $G$ of degree $n$ that satisfy $b(G) = \log n + 1$. They note that $G$ must be a subgroup of the affine group $\AGL_d(2)$ of affine transformations of $\F_2^d$ for some $d$, and that if $d$ is even then groups such as the split extension $2^d : \Sp(d,2)$ have this property. Upon investigation using a recursive approach for $d \leq 10$, we found that apart from the affine group $\AGL_d(2)$, there were no other primitive groups for odd $d$, and for even $d$, the only other example found was $2^d : \Sp(d,2)$. Consequently, we conjecture in this \thesis{} that these are the only groups satisfying this property. Limitations of this approach include memory and computational time, since the group found for $d = 10$ has order $25\,410\,822\,678\,459\,187\,200 \approx 2.5 \cdot 10^{19}$ and thus has many subgroups.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Include process to find that there are no proper subgroups $G < \AGL_d(2)$ with $b(G) = d + 1 = \log n + 1$ ($n = 2^d$) for $d = 1,2,3,5,7,9$, and for $d = 4,6,8,10$ we have found $2^d : \Sp_d(2)$ as candidates (unproven)
    \item Hypothesis: no proper subgroups for odd $d$, and only $2^d : \Sp_d(2)$ for even $d \geq 4$
    \item Idea: recursively check maximal subgroups (why does this work?) -- check ones that are primitive (if imprimitive then all subgroups imprimitive)
    \item Use greedy base algorithm: seems to perform better than default GAP algorithm (give example?)
    \item Need to check for base size SMALLER than what we want, since it's upper bounded by the thing in question (refer to lemma on base sizes of subgroups)
    \item Can also search for imprimitive groups, etc.
    \item Potential improvements: more efficient checking, different algorithms to find bases (brute force vs "probably true") ($d = 9$ case took 5 mins, $d = 10$ case took 100 mins, $d = 11$ case took over 24 hours without returning result)
    \item Also it considers only a few maximal subgroups: if we can get a list, then can check through systematically?
\end{itemize}
