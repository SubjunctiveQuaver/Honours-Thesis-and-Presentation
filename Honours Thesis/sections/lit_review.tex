\section{Results for non-large base primitive permutation groups}

Suppose we have a finite primitive permutation group $G$ of degree $n$. What can we say about $|G|$? (This problem attracted a lot of attention in the 19th century, as noted in \cite{moscatiello_roney-dougal2021}.) Of course, $|G| \leq n!$, and in the case that $G = \Sym(n)$ which is primitive, we have equality. In the case that $G = \Alt(n)$ which is also primitive, we have $|G| = n!/2 = O(n!)$, which suggests that even in nontrivial cases, the bound cannot be significantly improved on without further restrictions.

From \autoref{lem:blaha_nonredundant_size}, we have that $|G| \leq n^{b(G)}$. Thus, we may find upper bounds on $|G|$ by finding upper bounds on $b(G)$. One of the first results in this direction came in 1889, when Bochert proved in \cite{bochert1889} that for a primitive group $G$ of degree $n$ not containing the alternating group $\Alt(n)$, then $b(G) \leq n/2$. Compare this to \autoref{eg:symmetric_group_base} and \autoref{eg:alternating_group_base}, where we showed that $b(\Sym(n)) = n-1$ and $b(\Alt(n)) = n-2$, so the condition of not containing the alternating group immediately leads the upper bound on $b(G)$ improving by a factor of 2. Of course, since $\Alt(n)$ has index 2 in $\Sym(n)$, it is maximal, and thus every primitive group $G$ of degree $n$, apart from $\Alt(n)$ and $\Sym(n)$, has $b(G) \leq n/2$.

Improvements to these bounds have been made for primitive groups with certain additional properties. In 1984, Liebeck used the \hyperref[thm:cfsg]{classification of finite simple groups} and the \hyperref[thm:onan-scott]{O'Nan-Scott theorem} to improve the bound on $b(G)$ for \textit{non-large base} permutation groups.

\begin{definition}\label{def:large_base}
    A permutation group $G$ of degree $n$ is \textbf{large base} if there are integers $m$ and $r \geq 1$ with
    $$\Alt(m)^r \unlhd G \leq \Sym(m) \wr \Sym(r),$$
    where $\Sym(m)$ \hyperref[eg:product_action_Sm_subsets]{acts on $k$-element subsets} of $\{1,\dotsc,m\}$ for some $k$, and the \hyperref[def:wreath_product]{wreath product} has the \hyperref[def:product_action]{product action} of degree $n = \binom{m}{k}^r$ if $r > 1$.

    (Note that here we mean that $G$ contains a subgroup that is isomorphic to $\Alt(m)^r$, and $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of the wreath product $\Sym(m) \wr \Sym(r)$. Such convention is common in the literature, where inclusion is up to isomorphism.)
\end{definition}

By this definition, $\Alt(n)$ and $\Sym(n)$ with their natural actions are large base, where we choose $m = n$ and $r = 1$; recall that $\Sym(n) \wr \Sym(1) \cong \Sym(n)$, and $\Alt(n) \unlhd \Sym(n)$. Thus, the non-large base primitive groups exclude $\Alt(n)$ and $\Sym(n)$, and there is no conflict with Bochert's result in \cite{bochert1889}. The following result by Liebeck is found in \cite{liebeck1984}.

\begin{theorem}[Liebeck, 1984]\label{thm:liebeck1984}
    Let $G$ be a primitive group of degree $n$. Then one of the following holds:
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item $G$ is \hyperref[def:large_base]{large base}; or
        \item $b(G) < 9\log n$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

The result was proven in context improving lower bounds on $\mu(G)$, the \textbf{minimal degree} of $G \leq \Sym(\Omega)$, which is the smallest number of points moved by any non-identity element in $G$, i.e.
$$\mu(G) = \min_{g \in G \setminus \{1\}}|\{\alpha \in \Omega : \alpha^g \neq \alpha\}|.$$
For example, $\mu(\Alt(n)) = 3$ for $n \geq 3$, since $\Alt(n)$ contains 3-cycles (which move 3 points) but no transpositions (which move 2 points). From the relation that $b(G)\mu(G) \geq n$ for any transitive group $G$ of degree $n$, Liebeck concludes that either $G$ is large base, or that $\mu(G) > n/(9 \log n)$. The best result that was previously available, due to Babai in \cite{babai1981}, was that $\mu(G) > (1/2)(\sqrt{n} - 1)$ as long as $\Alt(n) \not\leq G$ (which would give, by properties of \hyperref[def:big_O_notation]{big-O},
$$b(G) < 2\sqrt{n}\left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)^{-1} = 2\sqrt{n}\left(1 + O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)\right) = 2\sqrt{n} + O(1) = O(\sqrt{n}),$$
i.e. a square-root bound on $b(G)$); the logarithmic bound on $b(G)$ in Liebeck represented a major improvement, and has been seen as a remarkable result \cite{moscatiello_roney-dougal2021}.

Liebeck's proof of \autoref{thm:liebeck1984} in \cite{liebeck1984} is approached in four steps. Firstly, a reduction to simple socle is performed: supposing the theorem is true for primitive groups with a nonabelian simple socle, then considering arbitrary primitive $G$ to prove part (i) of the theorem. Then, by considering cases in the O'Nan-Scott theorem, Liebeck shows that it suffices to assume $\Soc(G) = T$ is simple. The second step uses the \hyperref[thm:cfsg]{classification of finite simple groups} to analyse the structure of the nonabelian simple socle $T$, leading to the conclusion that $T$ is an alternating group, a group of Lie type, or a sporadic group, or that $|G| < n^9$. The third step shows that these non-large base groups from step two satisfy (ii) in \autoref{thm:liebeck1984}, and step four uses the previous steps to complete the proof.

In 2019, Halasi, Liebeck and Mar\'oti show in Theorem 1.1 of \cite{halasi2019} that the minimal base size of an arbitrary primitive group of degree $n$ satisfies $b(G) \leq 2(\log|G|/\log n) + 24$, with the multiplcative constant 2 being best possible, answering the well-known \textit{Pyber's conjecture} of the existence of a universal constant $c$ with $b(G) < c(\log|G|/\log n)$ for all primitive groups $G$, which was open until initially proven in 2018. In particular, \cite{halasi2019} shows that for most non-large base primitive groups $G$, the minimum base size satisfies $b(G) \leq 2\lfloor\log n\rfloor + 26$; in 2020, ``most'' was improved to \textit{``all''} \cite{moscatiello_roney-dougal2021}.

In 2021, building on the previously mentioned results of Liebeck in \cite{liebeck1984} and Halasi, Liebeck and Mar\'oti in \cite{halasi2019}, Moscatiello and Roney-Dougal improve the bound on $b(G)$ to $\lceil\log n\rceil + 1$ for non-large base primitive groups, with one exception. The following is Theorem 1 in this paper \cite{moscatiello_roney-dougal2021}; it is the main result.

\begin{theorem}[Moscatiello and Roney-Dougal, 2021]\label{thm:moscatiello_roney-dougal2021_1}
    Let $G$ be primitive group of degree $n$. If $G$ is non-\hyperref[def:large_base]{large base}, then either:
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item $G$ is the Mathieu group $M_{24}$ in its 5-transitive action of degree 24; or
        \item $b(G) \leq \lceil\log n\rceil + 1$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Moreover, there are infinitely many $G$ that are non-large base, for which $b(G) > \log n + 1$.
\end{theorem}

The \textbf{Mathieu groups} are five sporadic simple permutation groups $M_{11}$, $M_{12}$, $M_{22}$, $M_{23}$ and $M_{24}$ of degree 11, 12, 22, 23 and 24 respectively, with multiply transitive actions. They were introduced by Mathieu between 1861 and 1873, and were the first sporadic simple groups to be discovered. The final observation in \autoref{thm:moscatiello_roney-dougal2021_1} considers groups $G$ with $\log n + 1 < b(G) \leq \lceil\log n\rceil + 1$ (aside from the one exception of $M_{24}$), which would require that $b(G) = \lceil\log n\rceil + 1$ and that $n$ is not a power of 2.

Next, we present Theorem 5 from \cite{moscatiello_roney-dougal2021}, which is a more detailed version of \autoref{thm:moscatiello_roney-dougal2021_1}. It mostly investigates the case in (ii) above of $\log n + 1 \leq b(G) \leq \lceil\log n\rceil + 1$, which collapses to $b(G) = \lceil\log n\rceil + 1$.

\begin{theorem}[Moscatiello and Roney-Dougal, 2021]\label{thm:moscatiello_roney-dougal2021_5}
    Let $G$ be primitive subgroup of $\Sym(\Omega)$ with $|\Omega| = n$. Then $b(G) \geq \log n + 1$ if and only if $G$ is one of following:
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item A subgroup of $\AGL_d(2)$ with $b(G) = d + 1 = \log n + 1$.
        \item The \hyperref[def:symplectic_group]{symplectic group} $\Sp_d(2)$ (acting on cosets of $\GO^-_d(2)$) with $d \geq 4$; then $\log n + 1 < b(G) = \lceil\log n\rceil + 1$.
        \item A Mathieu group $M_n$ in its natural permutation representation with $n \in \{12,23,24\}$. If $n = 12$ or $23$ then $b(G) = \lceil\log n\rceil + 1$, while if $n = 24$ then $b(G) = 7 > \lceil\log n\rceil + 1$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

The infinite number of primitive groups $G$ of degree $n$ with $b(G) > \log n + 1$, as mentioned in \autoref{thm:moscatiello_roney-dougal2021_1}, is demonstrated by case (ii) in the more detailed theorem above; in case (i), it is conditional on the existence of such subgroups $G \leq \AGL_d(2)$ with $b(G) = d + 1$. Thus, the authors conclude the paper \cite{moscatiello_roney-dougal2021} with a question:

\begin{question}[Moscatiello and Roney-Dougal, 2021]\label{qn:moscatiello_roney-dougal2021}
    Which primitive groups $G \leq \Sym(n)$ satisfy $b(G) = \log n + 1$?
\end{question}

Of course, we require that $\log n$ is an integer, so that $n$ is a power of 2. By \autoref{thm:moscatiello_roney-dougal2021_5}, we must have $G \leq \AGL_d(2)$ for some $d$ (indeed, $\AGL_d(2)$ acts on $n = 2^d$ points; all other cases in the theorem have $b(G) > \log n + 1$), and if $d$ is even then it is noted in \cite{moscatiello_roney-dougal2021} that groups such as the split extension $2^d : \Sp_d(2)$ have this property. Are there any more such groups? What about for odd $d$? Investigating this question forms the remainder of this \thesis{}.

\section{Primitive subgroups of affine groups with given minimal base size}

The main result of this section is as follows, which is a new result.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:new_result}
    Let $G$ be a primitive subgroup of $\AGL_d(2)$ for some $d$, with the induced action of degree $n = 2^d$.
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item For $d = 1$, there is no such $G$ with $b(G) = d + 1 = \log n + 1$.
        \item For odd $3 \leq d \leq 9$ and $d = 2$, if $b(G) = d + 1 = \log n + 1$, then $G$ is the affine group $\AGL_d(2)$.
        \item For even $4 \leq d \leq 10$, if $b(G) = d + 1 = \log n + 1$, then $G$ is either $\AGL_d(2)$ or $2^d : \Sp_d(2)$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

Our approach to this result is to use \texttt{GAP} to iterate over potential primitive groups $G \leq \AGL_d(2)$ for some $d$ and compute a bound on $b(G)$ to eliminate those groups for which a base of size less than $d + 1$ is found. Using the \texttt{FinInG} (finite incidence geometry) package, we use a permutation representation of $\AGL_d(2)$ (a subgroup of $\Sym(2^d)$). Note that if a base of size $r$ is found for $G$, then $b(G) \leq r$, so if $r < d + 1$, we may eliminate such $G$.

To compute a base for $G$, \texttt{GAP} has the built-in command \texttt{BaseOfGroup}. However, in various test cases, we found that when compared to our implementation of the greedy base algorithm (\autoref{alg:blaha_greedy_base}) analysed in Blaha \cite{blaha1992}, the greedy algorithm sometimes found a smaller base than the the built-in command.

E.g. TODO show example where greedy beats built in

Thus, in the procedure to prove the main theorem, we use our implementation of \texttt{GreedyBase} instead of \texttt{BaseOfGroup} to compute a base for $G$ (see appendix for implementation). Both algorithms are fast; as discussed earlier, the greedy base algorithm is a polynomial-time algorithm. Of course, neither algorithm necessarily finds a minimum base for $G$, but in conjunction with \autoref{thm:blaha_greedy_size}, we see that a greedy base for $G$ has size at most $\lceil b(G)\log\log n \rceil + b(G) = O(\added{2}{b(G)}\log\log n)$, which is fine for our purposes.

The remainder of this section is dedicated to our approach to proving \autoref{thm:new_result}. Note that all subgroups take the induced subgroup action.

\begin{proof}[Proof of main theorem]
    First, we consider $d = 1$ in case (i). First note that $|\AGL_1(2)| = 2^1(2^1 - 1) = 2$, so if $G$ is a primitive subgroup then $G = \AGL_1(2)$ (the trivial subgroup is not transitive, thus not primitive). By \autoref{prop:agl_as_subgrp_of_gl}, $b(\AGL_1(2)) = 1 < d + 1$. This proves the result for case (i).

    Fix $d \geq 2$; first, note that if $G$ is the affine group $\AGL_d(2)$, then by \autoref{prop:agl_as_subgrp_of_gl} $b(G) = d + 1$. It remains to check proper primitive subgroups $G$ of $\AGL_d(2)$ to identify those with $b(G) = d + 1$. To do so, we adopt a ``brute force approach'' with a number of optimisations. It uses the following observations to avoid checking \textit{all} primitive subgroups of $\AGL_d(2)$, especially at any given stage in the process:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textit{Once we find a subgroup $G$ with $b(G) < d + 1$, we do not need to consider any of its (proper) subgroups.} This is due to \autoref{lem:base_of_subgroup}, which says that if $H \leq G$, then $b(H) \leq b(G) < d + 1$.
        \item \textit{If we find a non-primitive (imprimitive or intransitive) subgroup $G$, we do not need to consider any of its subgroups.} This is because subgroups of non-primitive groups (that act on $\Omega$) are non-primitive: suppose $\Sigma = \{\Delta^g : g \in G\}$ is a system of imprimitivity for $G$ transitive, where $\Delta$ is a block. Then for transitive $H \leq G$, $\Delta$ is clearly a block for the induced $H$-action, and $\Sigma = \{\Delta^h : h \in H\}$ is a system of imprimitivity for $H$. If $G$ is intransitive, then there is $\alpha \in \Omega$ with $\alpha^G \neq \Omega$; then $\alpha^H \subseteq \alpha^G$ for $H \leq G$, so $H$ is intransitive.
        \item \textit{If we have $G$ with $b(G) = d + 1$, we may recursively check maximal subgroups.} This is because $\AGL_d(2)$ is finite, so for arbitrary $H \leq G$, we have a \textit{finite} subgroup series
              $$H = H_0 < H_1 < \dotsb < H_k = G$$
              where each $H_i$ is maximal in $H_{i + 1}$ (else insert intermediate groups in the series). Thus, if $b(H) = d + 1$, then we must have $b(H_i) = d + 1$ for all $i$, by observation 1 above; recursively checking maximal subgroups will guarantee that we eventually find $H$.
        \item \textit{At each stage, it suffices to check maximal subgroups up to conjugacy.} This is because \autoref{prop:conjugate_subgroups_bases} implies that $b(G^\sigma) = b(G)$ for all $\sigma \in \Sym(\Omega)$, where $G$ acts on $\Omega$, so that we may consider a representative from each conjugacy class of subgroups. Moreover, if $G$ is maximal, then $G^\sigma$ is also maximal by \autoref{lem:conjugate_of_maximal_subgroup_is_maximal}, which implies that checking only maximal subgroups up to conjugacy will not overlook any conjugacy classes of subgroups. This observation also leads to a significant improvement over the na\"ive approach, since the size of a conjugacy class of subgroups may be large. However, it means that the subgroups found by the process are unique only up to conjugacy.
    \end{enumerate}

    (Note that these observations can be adapted for any group, to find (primitive) subgroups $H$ with $b(H) \geq r$ for any given $r$, by simply replacing ``$d + 1$'' with ``$r$''. If we wish to ignore the condition of primitivity, we may simply ignore observation 2 above.)

    Now, computing a base for $G$ is straightforward.

    TODO
\end{proof}

Based on the behaviour in \autoref{thm:new_result}, we make the following conjecture in the direction of \autoref{qn:moscatiello_roney-dougal2021}:

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:new_result}
    A primitive group $G \leq \Sym(n)$ satisfies $b(G) = \log n + 1$ if and only if $G$ is one of the following:
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item $n = 2^d$ with $d \geq 2$, and $G$ is the affine group $\AGL_d(2)$; or
        \item $n = 2^d$ with $d \geq 4$ even, and $G$ is the split extension $2^d : \Sp_d(2)$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{conjecture}

TODO: LIMITATIONS (TIME TAKEN) THUS MAYBE SURPRISING IF LARGE COUNTEREXAMPLES FOUND, WOULD NEED NEW APPROACH

Upon investigation using a recursive approach for $d \leq 10$, we found that apart from the affine group $\AGL_d(2)$, there were no other primitive groups for odd $d$, and for even $d$, the only other example found was $2^d : \Sp(d,2)$. Consequently, we conjecture in this \thesis{} that these are the only groups satisfying this property. Limitations of this approach include memory and computational time, since the group found for $d = 10$ has order $25\,410\,822\,678\,459\,187\,200 \approx 2.5 \cdot 10^{19}$ and thus has many subgroups.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Include process to find that there are no proper subgroups $G < \AGL_d(2)$ with $b(G) = d + 1 = \log n + 1$ ($n = 2^d$) for $d = 1,2,3,5,7,9$, and for $d = 4,6,8,10$ we have found $2^d : \Sp_d(2)$ as candidates (unproven)
    \item Hypothesis: no proper subgroups for odd $d$, and only $2^d : \Sp_d(2)$ for even $d \geq 4$
    \item Idea: recursively check maximal subgroups (why does this work?) -- check ones that are primitive (if imprimitive then all subgroups imprimitive)
    \item Use greedy base algorithm: seems to perform better than default GAP algorithm (give example?)
    \item Need to check for base size SMALLER than what we want, since it's upper bounded by the thing in question (refer to lemma on base sizes of subgroups)
    \item Can also search for imprimitive groups, etc.
    \item Potential improvements: more efficient checking, different algorithms to find bases (brute force vs "probably true") ($d = 9$ case took 5 mins, $d = 10$ case took 100 mins, $d = 11$ case took over 24 hours without returning result)
    \item Also it considers only a few maximal subgroups: if we can get a list, then can check through systematically?
\end{itemize}
