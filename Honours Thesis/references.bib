  abstract = {Given generators for a permutation group G on n letters, the question was posed as to whether a polynomial time greedy algorithm always finds a minimum base for G. We answer this in the negative. In fact, we show that the minimum base problem is NP-hard. We go on to exhibit a tight bound for the size of a base produced by the greedy algorithm; let M(G) denote the size of a minimum base for G, then the greedy algorithm produces a base of size O(M(G)log log n), and this bound is sharp with respect to worst case performance.}

abstract = {This chapter describes the computational methods in the study of permutation groups. It is useful to extend the determination of the primitive groups of low degree. With advances in group theory and the availability of electronic computers for routine calculations, it is feasible to carry out the determination as far as degree 30, and probably farther. The procedure combines the use of a computer with more conventional techniques. The primitive groups of a given degree n are determined. It is assumed that the primitive groups of degree less than n have already been determined. As a minimal normal subgroup of a primitive group is transitive and is a direct product of isomorphic simple groups, the first step is to take each of the known simple groups H, including the groups of prime order, determine the transitive groups M of degree n isomorphic to the direct product of one, or more copies of H, and then for each such group M find the primitive groups containing M as a normal subgroup.}
