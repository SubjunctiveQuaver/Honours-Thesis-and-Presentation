  abstract = {Given generators for a permutation group G on n letters, the question was posed as to whether a polynomial time greedy algorithm always finds a minimum base for G. We answer this in the negative. In fact, we show that the minimum base problem is NP-hard. We go on to exhibit a tight bound for the size of a base produced by the greedy algorithm; let M(G) denote the size of a minimum base for G, then the greedy algorithm produces a base of size O(M(G)log log n), and this bound is sharp with respect to worst case performance.}
